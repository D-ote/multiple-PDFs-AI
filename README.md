# 📚 Chat with Multiple PDFs using LangChain & Streamlit

### 🔍 Overview
This project is a PDF-based conversational chatbot that allows users to upload **multiple PDF documents** and ask questions about their content. The system utilizes LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS vector storage to provide accurate responses based on the uploaded documents.

The web interface is built using **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

### 🚀 Features
- ✅ Upload multiple PDF files
- ✅ Extract and preprocess text from PDFs
- ✅ Generate meaningful text chunks using LangChain
- ✅ Convert text into vector embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings
- ✅ Store and retrieve vector embeddings efficiently using FAISS
- ✅ Engage in context-aware conversations with a memory buffer
- ✅ Styled UI using CSS

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit (for UI)
- LangChain (for conversational AI)
- OpenAI API (for embeddings & language model)
